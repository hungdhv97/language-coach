# Docker Compose Configuration Example
# Copy this file to your environment directory (e.g., dev/docker-compose.env, prod/docker-compose.env)
# and adjust the values as needed

# Port mappings (host port - used by scripts to connect from host)
# Note: Port mappings are now hardcoded in docker-compose.{env}.yml files
# These values are used by scripts like migrate-all.sh to connect to the database
# Make sure ports are different for each environment if running multiple environments simultaneously
POSTGRES_PORT=5500
REDIS_PORT=6379
