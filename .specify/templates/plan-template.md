# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

For this feature, explicitly state how it complies with the project constitution
across the following areas (add concrete, testable bullets for each):

- **Code Quality & Consistency**: Linting/formatting tools, naming, avoidance of
  magic values, adherence to clean architecture boundaries.
- **Type Safety**: Types for data models and API contracts, avoidance of `any`
  (or equivalent), shared types between frontend/backend when applicable.
- **Error Handling & Observability**: Unified error schema, use of centralized
  error-handling layers, logging context (request IDs, key inputs, stack traces),
  and any metrics/tracing for critical flows.
- **API Design & Separation of Concerns**: Spec-first API design (OpenAPI or
  equivalent), controllers as orchestrators only, domain logic in services/use
  cases, infrastructure adapters for DB/cache/mq.
- **Security**: Authentication mechanism, RBAC approach, input validation (Zod or
  equivalent), protection against XSS/SQL injection/CSRF, rate limiting for
  sensitive endpoints, and secret management.
- **Performance & Scalability**: Pagination/streaming for large responses,
  stateless service design where possible, key database indexes, and basic FE/BE
  performance considerations.
- **Manual Testing Discipline**: Planned manual test scenarios (happy paths and
  failure cases) and smoke tests for critical flows before release.
- **Documentation & UX**: Required spec/docs updates, quickstart/onboarding
  implications, and how the feature respects the shared design system and UX
  consistency requirements.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
